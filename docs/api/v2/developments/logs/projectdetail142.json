The proposed Project included a request for annexation of the property into the City, General Plan and Eastern Dublin Specific Plan amendments to modify the existing land use designations from Low Density Residential and Rural Residential/Agriculture to 30-acres designated as Estate Residential and 127.3-acres designated as Open Space. The project also included Planned Development Zoning with a related Stage 1 and Stage 2 Development Plan that established development standards and allows construction of four custom estate residential homes (in the future). The area designated as Open Space will be maintained in a permanent conservation easement. The application also included a Development Agreement as required (at the time) by the Eastern Dublin Specific Plan.",
