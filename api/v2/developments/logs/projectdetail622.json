The existing retail building will be converted to a new auto dealer (Volvo). The dealership will occupy the entire existing retail structure while also filling the existing truck dock area to provide room for the parts department and the car wash facility. The second parcel will be the primary location for the car inventory. The project includes site modifications, including new landscaping and improved site circulation.",
